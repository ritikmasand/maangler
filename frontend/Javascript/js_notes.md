### Ways to add js in html file:

1. External: In this the js file is seperately written and then linked in html code.
2. Internal: In this the js code is written in the html file itself.
3. Inline: In this method, the code is written in line with the tags itself.

- For example:

```
    <!-- <script>
      alert("Welcome to javascript");
    </script> -->
    <!-- <button onclick="alert('Welcome to javascript')">Click Me</button> -->
    <!-- <script src="index.js"></script> -->
```

### Variables

- Variables are like containers which store data
  for example:

```
var name = "ritik";

console.log(name); // This is used to print something is Js.
```

### block of code

- Instructions/code written inside a curly bracket.

for example:

```
{
  var name = "Prachi";
  console.log(name);
  // block scope
}
```
